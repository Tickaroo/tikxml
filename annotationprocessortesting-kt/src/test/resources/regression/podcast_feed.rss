<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a developer spins up a virtual machine on AWS, that virtual machine could be purchased using one of several types of cost structures. These cost structures include on-demand instances, spot instances, and reserved instances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On-demand instances are often the most expensive, because the developer gets reliable VM infrastructure without committing to long-term pricing. Spot instances are cheap, spare compute capacity with lower reliability, that is available across AWS infrastructure. Reserved instances allow a developer to purchase longer term VM contracts for a lower price.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reserved instances can provide significant savings, but it can be difficult to calculate how much infrastructure to purchase. Aran Khanna is the founder of Reserved.ai, a company that builds cost management tools for AWS. He joins the show to talk about the landscape of cost management, and what he is building with Reserved.ai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine learning models require the use of training data, and that data needs to be labeled. Today, we have high quality data infrastructure tools such as TensorFlow, but we don’t have large high quality data sets. For many applications, the state of the art is to manually label training examples and feed them into the training process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snorkel is a system for scaling the creation of labeled training data. In Snorkel, human subject matter experts create labeling functions, and these functions are applied to large quantities of data in order to label it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if I want to generate training data about spam emails, I don’t have to hire 1000 email experts to look at emails and determine if they are spam or not. I can hire just a few email experts, and have them define labeling functions that can indicate whether an email is spam. If that doesn’t make sense, don’t worry. We discuss it in more detail in this episode.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Braden Hancock works on Snorkel, and he joins the show to talk about the labeling problems in machine learning, and how Snorkel helps alleviate those problems. We have done many shows on machine learning in the past, </span><a href="https://www.softwaredaily.com/posts/machine-learning"><span style="font-weight: 400;">which you can find on SoftwareDaily.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

For example, consider a session of a user taking a ride in an Uber. The user initiates the ride, and the ride might last for an hour. At the end of the ride, the user is charged for the ride and sent a transactional email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout this entire ride, there are many different services and database tables being accessed across the Uber infrastructure. The transactions across this infrastructure need to be processed despite server failures which may occur along the way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workflows are not just a part of Uber. Many different types of distributed operations at a company might be classified as a workflow: banking operations, spinning up a large cluster of machines, performing a distributed cron job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maxim Fateev is the founder of <a href="https://www.temporal.io/">Temporal.io</a>, and the co-creator of Cadence, a workflow orchestration engine. Maxim developed Cadence when he was at Uber, seeing the engineering challenges that come from trying to solve the workflow orchestration problem. Before Uber, Maxim worked at AWS on the Simple Workflow Service, which was also a system for running workflows. Altogether, Maxim has developed workflow software for more than a decade.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kafka is a distributed stream processing system that is commonly used for storing large volumes of append-only event data. Kafka has been open source for almost a decade, and as the project has matured, it has been used for new kinds of applications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kafka’s pubsub interface for writing and reading topics is not ideal for all of these applications, which has led to the creation of ksqlDB, a database system built for streaming applications that uses Kafka as the underlying infrastructure for storing data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Drogalis is a principal product manager at Confluent, where he helped develop ksqlDB. Michael joins the show to discuss ksqlDB, including the architecture, the query semantics, and the applications which might want a database that focuses on streams.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building a game is not easy. The development team needs to figure out a unique design and gameplay mechanics that will attract players. There is a great deal of creative work that goes into making a game successful, and these games are often built with low budgets by people who are driven by the art and passion of game creation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A game engine is a system used to build and run games. Game engines let the programmer work at a high level of abstraction, by providing interfaces for graphics, physics, and scripting. Popular game engines include Unreal Engine and Unity, both of which require a license that reduces the amount of money received by the game developer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Godot is an open source and free to use game engine. The project was started by Juan Linietsky, who joins the show to discuss his motivation for making Godot. We have done some great shows on gaming in the past, </span><a href="https://www.softwaredaily.com/search?query=gaming"><span style="font-weight: 400;">which you can find on SoftwareDaily.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">V8 is the JavaScript engine that runs Chrome. Every popular website makes heavy use of JavaScript, and V8 manages the execution environment of that code. The code that processes in your browser can run faster or slower depending on how “hot” the codepath is. If a certain line of code is executed frequently, that code might be optimized to run faster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">V8 is running behind the scenes in your browser all the time, evaluating the code in your different tabs and determining how to manage that runtime in memory. As V8 is observing your code and analyzing it, V8 needs to allocate resources in order to determine what code to optimize. This process can be quite memory intensive, and can add significant overhead to the memory overhead of Chrome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ross McIlroy is an engineer at Google, where he worked on a project called V8 Lite. The goal of V8 Lite was to significantly reduce the execution overhead of V8. Ross joins the show to talk about JavaScript memory consumption, and his work on V8 Lite. We have done some great shows on JavaScript in the past, </span><a href="https://www.softwaredaily.com/search?query=javascript"><span style="font-weight: 400;">which you can find on SoftwareDaily.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

Serverless apps were originally architected around Lambda, with the functions-as-a-service being used to glue together larger pieces of functionality and API services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, many of the common AWS services such as API Gateway and DynamoDB have functionality built in to be able to respond to events. These services can use Amazon EventBridge to connect to each other. In many cases, a developer does not need AWS Lambda to glue services together in order to build an event-driven application.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeremy Daly is the host of the Serverless Chats podcast, a show about patterns and strategies in serverless architecture. Jeremy joins the show to talk about modern serverless development, and the new tools available in the AWS ecosystem.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of these applications was a system for ingesting radio streams, transcribing the radio, and looking for duplicate information across the different radio stations.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another project from Cortico is called Local Voices Network. The Local Voices Network is built around a piece of hardware called a “digital hearth”, a specialized device that records discussions among people in a community. These community discussions are made available to journalists, public officials, and political candidates, creating a listening channel that connects these communities and stakeholders. Much of our conversation is focused on the engineering of the digital hearth, this device that sits in the center of community discussions.</span></p>

Over time, Messenger has grown to include group chats, video chats, animations, facial filters, stories, and many more features. Messenger is a tool for utility as well as for entertainment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Messenger is used both on mobile and on desktop, but the size of the mobile application is particularly important on mobile. There are many users who are on devices that do not have much storage space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Messenger has accumulated features, the iOS code base has grown larger and larger. Several generations of Facebook engineers have rotated through the company with the responsibility of working on Facebook Messenger, which has led to different ways of managing information within the same codebase. The iOS codebase had room for improvement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project Lightspeed was a project within Facebook that had the goal of making Messenger on iOS much smaller. Mohsen Agsen is an engineer with Facebook, and he joins the show to talk about the process of rewriting the Messenger app.</span></p>

The most popular bundler is webpack, which was originally released in 2012, before browsers widely supported ES Modules.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, every major browser supports the ES Module system, which improves the efficiency of JavaScript dependency management. Snowpack is a system for managing dependencies that takes advantage of the browser support for ES Modules.

After seven years of mobile food delivery, the volume of food ordered through these apps has become so large that entire restaurants can be sustained solely through the order flow that comes in from the apps. This raises the question as to why you even need an “on-prem” restaurant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cloud kitchen is a large, shared kitchen where food is prepared for virtual restaurants. These virtual restaurants exist only on mobile apps. There are no waiters, there are only the food delivery couriers who pick up the food from these warehouse-sized food preparation facilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A virtual restaurant entrepreneur could open up multiple restaurants operated from the same cloud kitchen. The mobile app user might see separate restaurant listings for a pizza place, a cookie bakery, and a Thai food restaurant, when all of them are operated by the same restaurateur.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ashley Colpaart is the founder of The Food Corridor, a system for cloud kitchen management. Ashley joins the show to talk about the dynamics of virtual restaurants and the cloud kitchen industry.</span></p>

With Slack and email, communication becomes more clear cut. Project management tools lay out the responsibilities and deliverables of each person. GitHub centralizes and defines the roles of developers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, remote work subtracts the role of nuanced conversation. There is no water cooler or break room. Work can become systematic, rigid, and completely transactional. Your co-workers are your allies, but they feel less like friends when you don’t see them every day. For some people, this can have a devastating long-term impact on their psyche.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managers have the responsibility of ensuring the health and productivity of the people that work with them. Managing an all-remote team includes a different set of challenges than an in-person team. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryan Chartrand is the CEO of X-Team, a team of developers who work across the world and collaborate with each other remotely. X-Team partners with large companies who need additional development work. Ryan joins the show to talk about the dynamics of leading a large remote workforce, as well as his own personal experiences working remotely.</span></p>

In a dynamically typed language, the programmer does not need to declare if a variable is an integer, string, or other type. In a statically typed language, the developer must declare the type of the variable upfront, so that the compiler can take advantage of that information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dynamically typed languages give a programmer flexibility and fast iteration speed. But they also introduce the possibility of errors that can be avoided by performing type checking. This is one of the reasons why TypeScript has risen in popularity, giving developers the option to add types to their JavaScript variables.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sorbet is a typechecker for Ruby. Sorbet allows for gradual typing of Ruby programs, which helps engineers avoid errors that might otherwise be caused by the dynamic type system.

Datomic users can query the complete history of the database, and Datomic has ACID transactional support. The data within Datomic is stored in an underlying database system such as Cassandra or Postgres. The database is written in Clojure, and was co-authored by the creator of Clojure, Rich Hickey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Datomic has a unique architecture, with a component called a Peer, which gets embedded in an application backend. A Peer stores a subset of the database data in memory in this application backend, improving the latency of database queries that hit this caching layer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marshall Thompson works at Cognitect, the company that supports and sells the Datomic database. Marshall joins the show to talk about the architecture of Datomic, its applications, and the life of a query against the database.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ClickUp is a project management and productivity system for organizations and individuals. The goal of ClickUp is to create a system that integrates closely with other project management systems, popular SaaS tools, and the Google Suite of docs and spreadsheets. The company was started in 2016, and despite raising zero outside capital, it has grown as rapidly as many venture-backed companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zeb Evans and Alex Yurkowski are the founders of ClickUp. They join the show to talk about their experience building the company. We talk through their process of scaling the infrastructure, and their philosophy of moving fast.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There have been several generations of infrastructure-as-code tools. Systems such as Chef, Puppet, Salt, and Ansible provided a domain-specific imperative scripting language that became popular along with the early growth of Amazon Web Services. Hashicorp’s Terraform project created an open source declarative model for infrastructure. Kubernetes YAML definitions are also a declarative system for infrastructure as code.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pulumi is a company that offers a newer system for infrastructure as code, combining declarative and imperative syntax. Pulumi programs can be written in TypeScript, Python, Go, or .NET. Joe Duffy is the CEO of Pulumi, and he joins the show to talk about his work on the Pulumi project and his vision for the company. Joe also discusses his twelve years at Microsoft, and how his work in programming language tooling shaped how he thinks about building infrastructure-as-code.</span></p>

At the level of core infrastructure, software investing is particularly difficult. Databases, virtualization, and large scale data processing tools are all complicated, highly competitive areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the software world has matured, it has become apparent just how big these infrastructure companies can become. Consequently, the opportunities to invest in these infrastructure companies have become highly competitive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a venture capital fund invests into an infrastructure company, the fund will then help the infrastructure company bring their product to market. This involves figuring out the product design, the sales strategy, and the hiring roadmap. A strong investor will be able to give insight into all of these different facets of building a software company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vivek Saraswat is a venture investor with Mayfield, a venture fund that focuses on early to growth-stage investments. Vivek joins the show to discuss his experience at AWS, Docker, and Mayfield, as well as his broad lessons around how to build infrastructure companies today.</span></p>

That fact is well understood by the software world. Unfortunately, it is not a simple process to surface useful information from this high volume of data. A human analyst needs to understand the business, formulate a question, and determine what metrics could reveal the answer to such a question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sisu is a system for automatically surfacing insights from large data sets within companies. A user of Sisu can select a database column that they are interested in learning more about, and Sisu will automatically analyze the records in the database to look for trends and relationships between that column and the other columns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if I have a database of user purchases, including how much money those users spent on each purchase, I can ask Sisu to analyze the purchase price column, and find what kinds of attributes correlate with a high purchase price. Perhaps there will be correlations such as age and city that I can use to understand my customers better. Sisu can automatically surface these correlations and display them to me to help me make business decisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peter Bailis is the CEO of Sisu Data and an assistant professor at Stanford. Peter joins the show to give his perspective on the development of Sisu, which came out of his research on data-intensive systems, including MacroBase, an analytic monitoring engine that prioritizes human attention.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world of web-based information has become easy to query. We can use search engines like Google, as well as APIs like Diffbot and Clearbit. Today, the physical world is not so easy to query, but it is becoming easier. Location data as a service is a burgeoning field, with some vendors offering products for satellite data, foot traffic, and other specific location-based domains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SafeGraph is a company that provides location data-as-a-service. SafeGraph data sets include data about businesses, patterns describing human movement, and geometric representations describing the shape and size of buildings. Ryan Fox Squire develops data products for SafeGraph, and he joins the show to talk about the engineering and strategy that goes into building a data-as-a-service company.</span></p>

<p>Descript is a software product for editing podcasts and video.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Descript is a deceptively powerful tool, and its software architecture includes novel usage of transcription APIs, text-to-speech, speech-to-text, and other domain-specific machine learning applications. Some of the most popular podcasts and YouTube channels use Descript as their editing tool because it provides a set of features that are not found in other editing tools such as Adobe Premiere or a digital audio workstation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Descript is an example of the downstream impact of machine learning tools becoming more accessible. Even though the company only has a small team of machine learning engineers, these engineers are extremely productive due to the combination of APIs, cloud computing, and frameworks like TensorFlow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Descript was founded by Andrew Mason, who also founded Groupon and Detour, and Andrew joins the show to describe the technology behind Descript and the story of how it was built. It is a remarkable story of creative entrepreneurship, with numerous takeaways for both engineers and business founders.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This data includes ride history, pricing information, mapping, routing, and financial transactions. The data is stored across a variety of different databases, data lakes, and queueing systems, and is processed at scale in order to generate machine learning models, reports, and data applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data workflows involve a set of interconnected systems such as Kubernetes, Spark, Tensorflow, and Flink. In order for these systems to work together harmoniously, a workflow manager is often used to orchestrate them together. A workflow platform lets a data engineer have a high-level view into how data moves through the system, and can be used to reason about retries, resource utilization, and scalability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flyte is a data processing system built and open-sourced at Lyft. Allyson Gale and Ketan Umare work at Lyft, and they join the show to talk about how Flyte works, and why they needed to build a new workflow processing system when there are already tools available such as Airflow.</span></p>

Before the cloud, businesses needed to buy physical servers in order to operate. There was an up-front cost that often amounted to tens of thousands of dollars required to pay for these servers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud computing changed the up-front capital expense to an ongoing operational expense, with businesses increasingly shifting to Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Compute Platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the initial motivation for moving onto cloud providers might have been decreased cost, over time the cloud providers have developed unique services that make software even easier to build than before. There has also been a proliferation of new software infrastructure companies that have been built on top of the cloud providers, giving rise to new databases, logging companies, and platform-as-a-service products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Danel Dayan is a venture investor with Battery Ventures and a co-author of the </span><a href="https://www.battery.com/powered/state-of-the-opencloud-2019/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State of the OpenCloud 2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a report that compiles a wide set of statistics and information on how cloud computing and open source are impacting the software industry. Danel joins the show to talk about his work as an investor, as well as his previous career at Google, where he worked on mergers and acquisitions.</span></p>

In GraphQL, a frontend developer does not have to worry about the request logic for individual backend services. The frontend developer only needs to know how to issue GraphQL requests from the client, and these requests are handled by a GraphQL server.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GraphQL is mostly used to issue queries across internal databases and services. But many of the data sources that a company needs to query in modern infrastructure are not databases&#8211;they are APIs like Salesforce, Zendesk, and Stripe. These API companies might store a large percentage of the data that a given company needs to query, and executing queries, subscriptions, and joins against these APIs is not a simple task.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OneGraph is a company that builds integrations with third-party services and exposes them through a GraphQL interface. Sean Grove is a founder of OneGraph, and he joins the show to explain the problem that OneGraph solves, how OneGraph is built, and some of the difficult engineering challenges required to design OneGraph. </span></p>

A data warehouse is often part of a data pipeline, which moves data through different areas of infrastructure in order to build applications such as machine learning models, dashboards, and reports.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modern data pipelines are often associated with the term “ELT” or Extract, Load, Transform. In the “ELT” workflow, data is taken out of a source such as a data lake, loaded into a data warehouse, and then transformed within the data warehouse to create materialized views on the data. Data warehouse queries are usually written in SQL, and for the last 50 years, SQL has been the primary language for executing these kinds of queries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DBT is a system for data modeling that allows the user to write queries that involve a mix of SQL and a templating language called Jinja. Jinja allows the analyst to blend imperative code along with the declarative SQL. Tristan Handy is the CEO of Fishtown Analytics, the company that created DBT, and he joins the show to discuss how DBT works, and the role it plays in modern data infrastructure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kent Dodds is a JavaScript teacher who focuses on React, JavaScript, and testing. In today’s episode, Kent provides best practices for building JavaScript applications, specifically React. He provides a great deal of advice on testing, which is unsurprising considering he owns TestingJavaScript.com. Kent is an excellent speaker who has taught thousands of people about JavaScript, so it was a pleasure to have him on the show.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kent is also speaking at </span><a href="https://www.reactathon.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reactathon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a San Francisco JavaScript conference taking place March 30th and 31st in San Francisco. This week we will be interviewing speakers from Reactathon, and if you are interested in JavaScript and the React ecosystem then stay tuned, and if you hear something you like, you can check out the Reactathon conference in person.</span></p>

This phrase has been used to describe the confusion and exhaustion around the volume of different tools required to be productive as a JavaScript developer. Frameworks, package managers, typing systems, state management, GraphQL, and deployment systems&#8211;there are so many decisions to make.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the present-day tooling choices, a JavaScript developer needs to watch the emerging developments in the ecosystem. ReactJS is evolving at a rapid clip, and newer primitives such as React Hooks and React Suspense allow developers to handle concurrency and networking more robustly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tejas Kumar works with G2i, a company that connects React developers with organizations that are looking for high-quality engineers. His role at G2i is head of vetting, which requires him to assess engineers for their competency in JavaScript-related technologies. Tejas joins the show to discuss the modern stack of technologies that a React developer uses to build an application. Full disclosure: G2i, where Tejas works, is a sponsor of Software Engineering Daily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tejas is also speaking at </span><a href="https://www.reactathon.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reactathon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a San Francisco JavaScript conference taking place March 30th and 31st in San Francisco.

Since then, the best practices for building and deploying these applications have steadily evolved with the technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ReactJS created consolidation around the view layer. The emergence of AWS Lambda created a new paradigm for backend execution. Serverless tools such as DynamoDB offer autoscaling abstractions. CDNs such as Cloudflare and Fastly can now do processing on the edge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brian LeRoux is the founder of Begin.com, a hosting and deployment company built on serverless tools.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guillermo Rauch is the creator of NextJS, a popular framework for building React applications. He is also the CEO of ZEIT, a cloud hosting company. Guillermo joins the show to discuss NextJS, and his vision for how the React ecosystem will evolve in the near future, as features such as React Suspense and Concurrent Mode impact the developer experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guillermo is also speaking at </span><a href="https://www.reactathon.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reactathon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a San Francisco JavaScript conference taking place March 30th and 31st in San Francisco. This week we will be interviewing speakers from Reactathon, and if you are interested in JavaScript and the React ecosystem then stay tuned, and if you hear something you like, you can check out the Reactathon conference in person.</span></p>

Knowledge workers within a large corporation can use low code tools to augment their usage of spreadsheets. Entrepreneurs can use low code tools to start businesses even without knowing how to code.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modern low code tools have benefited from steady improvements in cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks like ReactJS, and browser technology such as the V8 JavaScript engine. These building blocks led to the popular low code products such as Webflow, Bubble, Retool, and Airtable. The low code products are supported by a broad selection of domain-specific APIs such as Stripe, Twilio, and Zapier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ben Tossell runs </span><a href="https://www.makerpad.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Makerpad</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a site devoted to low-code and no-code applications. Makerpad describes how to use these tools to design sophisticated applications that don’t require you to write code. But they do require a different kind of software engineering. To create applications intelligently with low-code tools, you need to know how the tools fit together, and you need to be willing to persist through a process of iteration and debugging that is similar to traditional software engineering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ben joins the show to talk about his experience building low-code tools, the use cases for these tools, and his predictions for how they will impact the future of software.</span></p>

The desktop application is an Electron app, which is effectively a web browser dedicated to running Slack. This frontend is built with ReactJS and other JavaScript code, and the application is incredibly smooth and reliable, despite its complexity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a user boots up Slack, the application needs to figure out what data to fetch and where to fetch it from. Companies that use Slack heavily have thousands of messages in their history, and Slack needs to determine which of those should be pulled into the client. There are profile images, and logos, and custom emojis, all of which are used to define the user’s custom workspace experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anuj Nair joined Slack in late 2017. In the years since he has been with the company, Anuj helped rewrite the Slack frontend client, including work on the bootup experience, the caching infrastructure, and the role of service workers. Anuj joins the show to discuss his work on the Slack frontend architecture and the canonical view layer problems that Slack faces.</span></p>

These data workflows involve spreadsheets, CSV files, and tedious manual work to be done by a knowledge worker. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, data might need to be taken from Salesforce, filtered for new customers, and piped into Mailchimp. Or perhaps you need to sort all your customers to find only the ones who have spent more than $50.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These data workflows might require some basic knowledge of SQL, or an understanding of how to make an API request. Not everyone knows how to execute these technical commands. A software company can be slowed down due to a shortage of technical analysts who have the necessary programming skills to build these data workflows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parabola is a low-code tool for building data workflows. Parabola lets the user drag and drop different components together to build an application without using a programming language. Parabola lowers the technical barrier for knowledge workers who want to build these kinds of data workflows. Alex Yaseen is the CEO of Parabola, and he joins the show to talk about the ideas behind Parabola and his goals with the company. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The application infrastructure that has been built around cryptocurrency is mostly to support these use cases. At some point in the future, perhaps cryptocurrencies can be used as a global medium of exchange that is accepted at the grocery store. Perhaps we will use the blockchain for supply chain management, and as a universal ledger for real estate ownership.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But today, cryptocurrencies are mostly used for speculative trading. Users buy and sell different cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, looking to make short-term profits. And the markets for trading cryptocurrencies have evolved to have a sophistication that looks like the centralized markets of derivatives and leverage-based day trading.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term “decentralized finance” refers to this phenomenon of cryptocurrency lending markets. Decentralized finance increases the volume of speculated capital by providing liquidity through smart contracts. This short-term liquidity is often collateralized by a volatile cryptocurrency such as Ethereum, creating an opportunity for a type of market participant called a “liquidator.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tom Schmidt is an investor with Dragonfly Capital, a cryptoasset investment firm. Tom joins the show to describe the dynamics of decentralized finance.</span></p>

Platform engineering teams build tools that allow the other teams throughout the organization to work more effectively. A platform engineering team handles problems such as continuous integration, observability, and service discovery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other teams throughout a company use the tools that a platform engineering team builds. For example, there is a team at Airbnb that builds the search and discovery system that is used by customers who are looking for a place to stay. That team does not want to have to worry about how they are deploying, how their service is being logged, and how to scale up. All of that should be taken care of by the platform engineering team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a large company like Airbnb, there is so much happening across the infrastructure. Services are being deployed, services are having outages, databases are being resharded. With all of this change occurring, it can be difficult for a team to pinpoint the cause of a service outage. Digging through logs and dashboards is often insufficient.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joey Parsons is the founder of Effx, a company that is building a platform for observing and managing the changes across the infrastructure. Effx is like a newsfeed for a service. An application instrumented with Effx gives the engineers a single endpoint that they can navigate to for understanding the history of their service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joey joins the show to talk about his experience as an infrastructure engineer at Airbnb, and how that experience informs the work of his new company, Effx.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is SMS, mobile phone updates, emails, and native application updates. If you order a ride from Uber, you might receive a text message and a push notification at the same time. If an app overloads the user with notifications, the user might end up annoyed and delete the app from their phone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But perhaps all of these notifications are necessary. You would rather get three simultaneous notifications from your food delivery app than fail to get your food on time. If you are the mobile application developer building the food delivery app, what other choice do you have?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At large companies such as Linkedin, there are entire teams devoted to figuring out how to optimize the notifications that they send you. It has a surprisingly large impact on the usability of a mobile application. Troy Goode is the founder of Courier, a company that provides notification optimization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This might sound like a small, trivial problem. But it actually has a large impact on the usage of apps. And it is not an easy engineering problem. Troy joins the show to talk about the problem that Courier solves and the backend infrastructure that powers it. Courier is built entirely on serverless APIs. This is a great case study in how to build a completely scalable infrastructure product based on serverless tools.</span></p>

These frameworks often require the application developer to write imperative logic describing how that data should be processed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, a high volume of clickstream data that is getting buffered to Kafka needs to have a stream processing system evaluate that data to prepare it for a data warehouse, Spark, or some other queryable environment. In practice, many developers simply want to have the high volume of data become queryable in the fewest number of steps possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Materialize is a streaming SQL materialized view engine that provides materialized views over streaming data. The materialized views are incrementally updated over time and reconciled with new data that may have come in out of order.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arjun Narayan and Frank McSherry are the co-founders of Materialize, a company whose technology is based on the Naiad paper, which was written at Microsoft Research. Arjun and Frank join the show to talk about modern streaming systems and their strategy for taking an academic paper and productizing it.</span></p>

When a developer rents this infrastructure via an API call, a virtual server is instantiated on physical machines. That virtual server needs to be made addressable through the allocation of an IP address to make it reachable from the open Internet. When the virtual server starts to receive too much traffic, that traffic needs to be load balanced with another virtual server.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The backend networking code that runs a cloud provider needs to be fast, secure, and memory-efficient. Languages that fit that description include C++, Rust, and Go. Digital Ocean’s low-level networking code is mostly written in Go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sneha Inguva is an engineer with Digital Ocean who has written and spoken about writing networking applications using Go. She joins the show to talk about her work at Digital Ocean, including the implementation of a DHCP server, a network server that assigns IP addresses and other parameters to devices that sit on that network.</span></p>

At the beginning of a data pipeline, a data set might be pulled from a database, a distributed file system, or a Kafka topic. Throughout a data pipeline, different data sets are joined, filtered, and statistically analyzed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of a data pipeline, data might be put into a data warehouse or Apache Spark for ad-hoc analysis and data science. At this point, the end-user of the data set expects that data to be clean and accurate. But how do we have any guarantees about the correctness?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abe Gong is the creator of <a href="https://greatexpectations.io/?utm_source=external-publication&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_campaign=software-engineering-daily-201902">Great Expectations</a>, a system for d</span>ata pipeline testing. In Great Expectations, the developer creates tests called “expectations”, which verify certain characteristics of the data set at different phases in a data pipeline. This helps ensure that the end result of a multi-stage data pipeline is correct.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abe joins the show to discuss the architecture of a data pipeline and the use cases of Great Expectations.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A data warehouse is a crucial piece of infrastructure for a large company, because it can be used to answer complex questions involving a large number of data points. But a data warehouse usually cannot hold all of a company’s data at any given time. Users need to move a subset of the data into the data warehouse by reading large files from a data lake on disk and putting that data into the data warehouse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process of moving data from one place into another is broken down into three sequential steps, often called “ETL” (extract, transform, load) or “ELT” (extract, load, transform). In ETL, the data is extracted from a source such as a data lake, transformed into a schema that is customized for the data warehouse application, and then loaded into the data warehouse. In ELT, the last two steps are reversed, because modern systems can often leave the necessary schema transformation until after the data has been loaded into the data warehouse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matthew Scullion is the CEO of Matillion, a company that specializes in building tools for data transformations. Matthew joins the show to talk about the problem of data transformation, and how that problem has evolved over the nine years since he started Matillion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of these applications used supervised learning, a process in which labeled data sets are used to find correlations between the labels and the trends in that underlying data. But supervised learning is only one application of machine learning. Another broad set of machine learning methods is described by the term “reinforcement learning.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reinforcement learning involves an agent interacting with its environment. As the model interacts with the environment, it learns to make better decisions over time based on a reward function. Newer AI applications will need to operate in increasingly dynamic environments, and react to changes in those environments, which makes reinforcement learning a useful technique.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reinforcement learning has several attributes that make it a distinctly different engineering problem than supervised learning. Reinforcement learning relies on simulation and distributed training to rapidly examine how different model parameters could affect the performance of a model in different scenarios.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ray is an open source project for distributed applications. Although Ray was designed with reinforcement learning in mind, the potential use cases go beyond machine learning, and could be as influential and broadly applicable as distributed systems projects like Apache Spark or Kubernetes. Ray is a project from the Berkeley RISE Lab, the same place that gave rise to Spark, Mesos, and Alluxio.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The RISE Lab is led by Ion Stoica, a professor of computer science at Berkeley. He is also the co-founder of Anyscale, a company started to commercialize Ray by offering tools and services for enterprises looking to adopt Ray. Ion Stoica returns to the show to discuss reinforcement learning, distributed computing, and the Ray project.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These stream processing systems often build off of the MapReduce algorithm for collecting and aggregating large volumes of data, but instead of processing a calculation over a single large batch of data, they process data on an ongoing basis. There are so many different stream processing system for this same use case&#8211;Storm, Spark, Flink, Heron, and many others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why is that? When there seems to be much more consolidation around the Hadoop MapReduce batch processing technology, why are there so many stream processing systems?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One explanation is that aggregating the results of a continuous stream of data is a process that very much depends on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">time</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. At any given point in time, you can take a snapshot of the stream of data, and any calculation based on that data is going to be out of date by the time that your calculation is finished. There is a latency between when you start calculating something, and when you finish calculating it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are other design decisions for a distributed stream processing system. What data do you keep in memory? What do you keep on disk? How often do you snapshot your data to disk? What is the method for fault tolerance? What are the APIs for consuming and processing this data?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maximilian Michels has worked on the Apache Flink and Apache BEAM stream processing systems, and currently works on data infrastructure at Lyft. Max joins the show to discuss the tradeoffs of different stream processing systems and his experiences in the world of data processing.</span></p>

This data gets dumped into a data lake for long-term storage, then pulled into memory for processing and analysis. Once it is in memory, it is often read into a dashboard, which presents a human with a visualization of the data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The end-user who is consuming this data is often a data scientist who is looking at the data to find trends and design new machine learning models. Another kind of user is the operational analyst. An operational analyst is creating complex queries across this data to find latencies in the infrastructure, or perhaps slicing and dicing clickstream data that is coming from online advertisements, in order to figure out how to tweak those advertising algorithms and spend money more effectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For an operational analyst, a key use case for a data warehouse is fast, interactive querying. The operational analyst needs to be able to query the data to quickly create a dashboard, make judgments based on that dashboard, and then change the query slightly to look at a slightly different dashboard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Druid is a high-performance database that is used for these kinds of queries. Druid is used for ad-hoc queries and operational analytics. Imply Data is a company that builds visualization, monitoring, and security around Druid. Jad Naous is vice president of R&amp;D for Imply, and he joins the show to talk about the use case for Druid, the architecture, and the business model of Imply.</span></p>

Across a data platform, there is a multitude of data sources: databases, a data lake, data warehouses, a distributed queue like Kafka, and external data sources like Salesforce and Zendesk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A user of the data platform often has a question that requires multiple data sources to answer. How does this user join two data sources from a data lake? How does this user join data across a transactional database and a data lake? How does the user join data from two different data warehouse technologies? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presto is an open source tool originally developed at Facebook. Presto allows a user to query a data platform with a SQL statement. That query gets parsed and executed across the data platform to read from any heterogeneous data source. For some use cases, Presto is replacing the technology Hadoop MapReduce-based technology Hive. For other use cases, Presto is solving a problem in a completely novel way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justin Borgman joins the show to discuss the motivation for Presto, the problems it solves, and the architecture of Presto. He also talks about the company he started, Starburst Data, which sells and supports technologies built around Presto.</span></p>

Nubank has more than 20 million customers, and has accumulated a high volume of data over the six years since it was started.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2020/01/30/whats-behind-the-rise-of-challenger-banks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile computing and cloud computing have given rise to “challenger banks”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that operate more like software companies. When a software company reaches the size that Nubank is at today, it needs a data platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A data platform is a collection of different technologies that move data into different storage formats and applications, so that different members of an organization can access that data. New data often enters an organization through an OLTP database, which supports user transactions. That data is copied into a data lake, which provides cheap bulk storage. From the data lake, the data is moved into a data warehouse system for fast access. Along the way, tools like Kafka, Spark, and S3 are used to implement the needs of the data platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data platform architecture is not an exact science. Different companies build their data platform based on their own unique requirements. Previous shows have covered the data infrastructure companies like Lyft, Uber, and Facebook. Today’s show is another case study in data infrastructure, with a modern bank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a previous episode, we covered the engineering of Nubank. Sujith Nair from Nubank joins today’s show to talk about the data infrastructure of the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you enjoy the show, you can find all of our past episodes about data infrastructure by going to </span><a href="https://www.softwaredaily.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoftwareDaily.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and searching for the technologies or companies mentioned.

As open source has become closely tied with the entire software development lifecycle, The Changelog has expanded its coverage to the broader software industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since starting the podcast ten years ago, Adam Stacoviak and Jerod Santo have become full-time podcasters, and they have started several other podcasts within the Changelog network, including </span><a href="https://changelog.com/gotime"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go Time</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://changelog.com/jsparty"><span style="font-weight: 400;">JS Party</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://changelog.com/practicalai"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Practical AI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Throughout all of their shows, there is a consistent theme of technical, entertaining conversations about software.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the last decade, so much has changed within open source: GitHub became the de facto social network for open source; Kubernetes created a widely used platform for distributed systems; React has given frontend developers a component system to consolidate around. Adam and Jerod return to the show to discuss their perspective on the past and future of open source, and their learnings from interviewing influential software professionals for 10 years.</span></p>

Animations can be seen in messaging apps, where animated reactions can convey rich feelings over a text interface. Loading screens can become less boring through animation, and voice assistant products can feel more alive through animation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But we still don’t see much animation in our everyday applications. This is partly because animation tooling is difficult to use. To make an animation, the typical workflow is to go into a tool like After Effects, render your animation, and then export that animation in a movie format. This format is not dynamic enough to be easily used on the wide variety of development platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The animation library Lottie did improve this tooling by creating a system for exporting animations to JSON and allowing them to easily scale up and down as vectors. But the animations still were simple and unidirectional. The developer did not have much freedom for how to move an animation in response to user input.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rive is a system for creating dynamic, movable animated objects. Rive allows for the creation of animated elements that respond to user input. Rive has a tool that runs in the browser and allows the user to define the animation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The animations in Rive use a bone system that allows animators and designers to define the points of the animated sprite that the developer can then manipulate with code. This improves the painful handoff process that exists between animators and developers, and gives the developer some programmatic control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guido and Luigi Rosso are the founders of Rive and they join the show to talk about the frictions of animation tooling, and what they have built to improve</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, there is software inside the vehicles. These vehicles can operate autonomously, they collect large amounts of data, and they are supported by a large system of cloud services.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is also an element of human nature. Consumer trends can make or break the viability of a new product. And early stage venture investing is always a bet on a small team or individual founder. Early stage investments are usually into companies that have not found perfect traction with their product. Judging the worth of an early stage investment means judging the likelihood that the founders can make their vision a reality.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.villageglobal.vc/podcast/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Venture Stories</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a podcast that explores the wide spectrum of ideas that go into venture investing. Shows include two person interviews on economics, social networking, food technology, cryptocurrencies, and consumer psychology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Erik Torenberg is a co-founder and partner of Village Global, an early stage venture capital firm. He is also the host of Venture Stories. Erik joins the show to discuss investing, media, and the kinds of new technology companies that are being created today.</span></p>

Etrade and Schwab have allowed individual traders to buy securities for decades. Robinhood built a business around a similar model, but also removed the commission. Wealthfront and Betterment provide “roboadvisor” services that abstract away the underlying securities and focus on managing a risk profile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of these services has a programmatic execution system for managing assets. In order for a developer to build a product like Robinhood or Wealthfront, that developer needs access to an API that can execute trades.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alpaca is an API for stock trading. Alpaca can be used to build financial products, apps, and algorithmic trading programs. Yoshi Yokokawa is the founder of Alpaca, and he joins the show to talk about why he built an API for trading and the potential applications of Alpaca. Yoshi’s background includes work in finance at Lehman Brothers, a period spent as an individual day trader, and the previous company he started selling custom trading algorithms to enterprises.</span></p>

These companies also have a large surface area across the enterprise. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are hundreds of services and databases that are fulfilling user requests. As these requests enter the infrastructure of the enterprise, the requests travel through the different services and result in database queries, payments, and other transactions. These transactions result in the generation of log messages. The log messages tell the story of what is happening across the entire company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Log messages can provide valuable data for security and site reliability engineering. But analyzing a high volume of log data requires a scalable system that can account for that high volume. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jack Naglieri is the CEO of Panther Labs. He previously worked at Airbnb, where he helped develop a system called StreamAlert. At Airbnb, log messages are buffered into distributed queueing systems like Kafka or Kinesis, and they are written to bucket storage systems like S3. Those logs are processed by AWS Lambda functions that test the log messages for rules defined by a system operator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jack left Airbnb and started Panther Labs to generalize the tools he built within Airbnb and build a company around the same ideas. Jack joins the show to discuss modern logging infrastructure, his work at Airbnb, and his experience building Panther.</span></p>

Application services need multiple instances for scalability and failover. Large databases are sharded onto multiple nodes. Logging services, streaming frameworks, and continuous integration tools all require the orchestration of more than one server.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deploying a distributed system has historically been difficult because the nodes of the system must be managed by the underlying infrastructure. If I have a distributed database that I want to deploy, the complexity of that deployment is going to be different depending on whether I am running on AWS, or VMware, or my own bare metal server infrastructure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heterogeneous server infrastructure makes it hard to sell distributed applications that get deployed to that infrastructure. A vendor that is selling a distributed database would need to figure out how to make their database work on the infrastructure of any given customer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kubernetes has simplified the process of deploying a distributed application. Kubernetes is a container orchestration system that has steadily grown in popularity, to the point where the ecosystem is mature and the software is stable. Now that the software industry has a reliable, portable means of deploying a distributed application, the enterprise software market is becoming easier to enter for companies that sell a distributed application.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Replicated is a company that builds products for software delivery. Replicated allows for the distribution and updating of applications that would have been hard to deploy in the past. Grant Miller and Marc Campbell are the CEO and CTO of Replicated, and they join the show to talk about the modern enterprise software market, and the process of delivering software to companies that might otherwise have trouble consuming it. Full disclosure: Replicated is a sponsor of Software Engineering Daily.</span></p>

<p>Chat systems have been a part of software development for decades. Older systems like Pidgin and Yammer were surpassed by newer systems like HipChat. And when Slack was created, it quickly became a part of most software companies. But Slack does not fulfill the needs of every company.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mattermost is an open-source chat system. Mattermost can be configured to work within enterprises that have strong constraints around compliance and data governance. Whereas Slack is a SaaS product that requires users to send their data to the cloud servers managed by Slack, Mattermost allows the enterprise to decide how data moves through services, and where the databases are hosted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian Tien is the CEO of Mattermost, and he joins the show to talk about why many companies need their chat system to be hosted in a private cloud or on-premises. In a </span><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/12/17/mattermost-self-hosted-slack-alternative-with-corey-hulen/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">previous episode with CTO Corey Hulen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we discussed the engineering behind the company. In today’s episode, we explore the management and strategy of the business, as well as some additional engineering, since Ian Tien’s background is as a software engineer and computer scientist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The word “DevOps” has a different definition depending on who you ask. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some people, it is about the process of managing and releasing code. It can involve container management and server orchestration. It can involve infrastructure-as-code, and safer configuration management. In addition to a set of technologies, DevOps can be seen as a management concept that describes agile practices, and breaking down communication barriers between different teams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing that most software companies have decided is that whatever DevOps is, we want it. We want to release more software, we want to do it faster, and we want to do it safer. We want streamlined communication between management and engineering. We want a full understanding of the “value chain” of software.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the elusiveness of a single description for what DevOps is, GitLab can credibly describe itself as a tool that satisfies the DevOps needs of most enterprises. GitLab started as an open source version control management system based on Git. It has expanded into products that include continuous integration, security, issue tracking, and monitoring. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trajectory of GitLab into such a large platform is something that nobody anticipated. The best explanation for how it happened is that it is the downstream result of an engineer within GitLab deciding that the code hosting product needed to have a continuous integration product bundled with it as an option for a tightly coupled, unified workflow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, there are many enterprises trying to make a big set of changes to their development practices. The world is consolidating around Git for version control and Kubernetes for container management. Almost every enterprise is figuring out a “cloud strategy”. Every team wants to have continuous integration, and they want it to have some security products paired with that release workflow in a popular, vaguely defined set of practices known as “DevSecOps”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With so many changes coming to enterprises, it turns out that many of these enterprises just want some sane defaults. When GitLab came to market with a bundled CI and code hosting product, the company discovered that the customers were very happy to have integrated tools that worked well out of the box. This was in stark contrast to the years of NxN tooling integration that an enterprise would have to make to stitch together their broad range of carefully selected tools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sid Sibrandij is the CEO of GitLab, and he joins the show for a conversation about how GitLab arrived at its product development strategy. In a previous episode, </span><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2019/03/15/gitlab-with-sid-sijbrandij/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sid discussed some of the core features and history of GitLab.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Today’s show expands on many of the subjects we explored previously. We also had a spirited discussion of the modern nature of work, and how GitLab’s unique culture and fully remote team have evolved as the company has scaled.</span></p>

<p>The ridesharing infrastructure of Lyft has a high volume of traffic that is mostly handled by servers on AWS. When Vicki Cheung joined Lyft in 2018, the company was managing containers with an internally built container scheduler. One of her primary goals at the company was to move Lyft to Kubernetes.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today’s episode, Vicki gives an overview of Lyft infrastructure and the core engineering problems within the company. One subject she touched on was the network communications between the user on a mobile phone and the cloud backend. This was a topic we explored in detail on a previous episode about </span><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2019/07/25/envoy-mobile-with-matt-klein/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Envoy Mobile with Matt Klein</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vicki also discussed the broader Kubernetes ecosystem, as well as her time at OpenAI, where she managed infrastructure deployments for scheduling large machine learning jobs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the Internet was reimagined with the software and hardware infrastructure we have today, what would it look like?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is the question that DFINITY is working on answering. DFINITY’s goal is to build a decentralized, secure Internet computer. DFINITY takes concepts from the cryptocurrency world, but it is focused on computation, not financial products. DFINITY can be thought of as a decentralized cloud provider, with redundancy and scalability properties that are achieved by operating on data centers across the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DFINITY wants to host web applications such as the ones that we use today on centralized servers. A developer who wants to run their application on DFINITY compiles their code to WebAssembly and deploys it to the DFINITY decentralized runtime. Transactions across DFINITY applications are processed through a collateralized proof-of-stake system to ensure reliable, decentralized computation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DFINITY is an ambitious project, and it would seem nearly impossible to bring to market if not for the quality of the team. DFINITY has hired Andreas Rossburg, a co-designer of WebAssembly, as well as talented engineers across security, web development, and backend infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominic Williams is the president and chief scientist of DFINITY, and he joins the show to talk about the vision for DFINITY and the roadmap to making it a reality.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Webflow is a visual programming tool used by designers, developers, and other technical users. Webflow is a leader in the “low code” or “no code” category of software tools that has become prominent in the last few years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Webflow has been years in the making. </span><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2019/10/11/webflow-no-code-with-vlad-magdolin/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a previous show with Webflow CEO Vlad Magdalin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, he told the story of being heads down on Webflow, steadily working through the engineering problems that stood between him and his vision of a visual programming environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the early days, it was unclear who would even want to use Webflow. A critic of Webflow might have said that Webflow was too high level for developers, and too technical for designers. But Webflow caters to a large subset of developers and designers who want the kind of low code experience that Webflow provides. The product has also helped define a new category of knowledge worker: the “visual programmer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bryant Chou is a co-founder of Webflow and was the CTO in the early days. He joins the show to discuss the engineering problems that the company has had to work through, and his perspective on how Webflow fits into the software market going forward.</span></p>

<p>Software has changed the way the world functions. The rapid pace of change has made it difficult to know how to navigate the new world. Knowledge workers who want to keep advancing in their careers develop a strategy of continuous learning in order to adapt to these changes.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">O’Reilly Media has existed for almost 40 years, providing resources for the technical consumer. As O’Reilly has expanded its product line from books to conferences to online learning, the business has grown slowly but steadily. That business trajectory stands in contrast to many of the software companies that are financially structured to either grow rapidly or die.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, O’Reilly has a large impact on the software ecosystem. Software professionals congregate at O’Reilly conferences. Enterprises pay O’Reilly to educate their employees. And O’Reilly continues to grow into new product lines, recently acquiring the interactive learning platform Katacoda, which can be used to learn about Kubernetes and other popular technologies.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/07/06/future-projection-with-tim-oreilly/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a previous episode, we discussed Tim O’Reilly’s book “What’s The Future”.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In today’s show, Tim returns to the show to discuss his experience building O’Reilly, and how his business philosophy contrasts with much of the assumed wisdom of software company building.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GraphQL has become a core piece of infrastructure for many software applications. GraphQL is used to make requests that are structured as GraphQL queries and responded to through a GraphQL server. The GraphQL server processes the query and fetches the response from the necessary databases, APIs, and backend services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around 2016, when GraphQL was becoming popular, a company called Meteor was deciding what to do with its business. Meteor was started off of the popular framework MeteorJS, a system for building real-time JavaScript applications. MeteorJS was loved by many developers, but Meteor needed to decide if it was the most viable opportunity that it could be pursuing with its resources. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the vantage point within the Meteor company, there were some trends in the frontend ecosystem that were potentially disruptive to the viability of Meteor. There were also some large potential opportunities. The dramatic change to the frontend was largely coming as a downstream effect of Facebook’s open source technologies: React and GraphQL. Amidst these changes, Meteor shifted the company’s efforts entirely towards GraphQL and renamed the company Apollo. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geoff Schmidt is the CEO of Apollo, and he joins the show to talk about the GraphQL ecosystem, the business opportunities around GraphQL, and the process of pivoting from Meteor to Apollo.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The JavaScript ecosystem stretches across frontend, backend, and middleware. There are newer tools such as GraphQL, Gatsby, and WebAssembly. There are frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular. There is complex data handling with streams, caches, and TensorFlow.js.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JavaScript is unlike any other ecosystem, because a single language can be used to construct every part of an application. Because JavaScript is used for such a broad spectrum of use cases, the amount of tooling available can be intimidating to someone new to the ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kevin Ball is a host of </span><a href="https://changelog.com/jsparty"><span style="font-weight: 400;">JS Party</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a podcast on </span><a href="https://changelog.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Changelog network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Kevin joins the show to give his perspective on the JavaScript ecosystem.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud infrastructure is usually consumed in the form of virtual machines or containers. These VMs or containers are running on a physical host machine that is also running other VMs and containers. This is called multitenancy. Servers across cloud providers such as AWS have a high utilization because there are multiple virtual instances running on each physical server host.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud computing has led to a low cost of compute infrastructure. But in some cases, this low cost comes at the price of not being able to control the underlying hardware with as much precision as the user would want. Some users want specific types of hardware. Other users want to be using dedicated hardware that does not risk the “noisy neighbor” problem of sharing a physical server with some other application that is using most of the resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Packet is a company that provides remote access to baremetal infrastructure. The user experience is similar to that of a cloud provider, but with more control over how a given physical host will be used. Zachary Smith is the CEO of Packet and Nathan Goulding is the chief architect. Zach and Nathan join the show to talk about the business and the engineering behind Packet, as well as the future goals for where they want to take the company. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edge computing is the usage of servers that are geographically close to the client device.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first common use case for edge computing was CDNs: content-delivery networks. A content delivery network placed media files such as images and videos on multiple servers throughout the world. These are big files, and they take lots of bandwidth to transfer. By placing them at CDNs, the files would be closer to any user around the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These early use cases for edge computing were purely about storing large files. But the vast majority of compute still took place at the central application servers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over time, users have required faster and faster application experiences. Today, an increasing amount of compute has been moved to the edge, in addition to the existing storage applications. More user data is being cached at the edge to make for quicker transactional processing. Machine learning model training and hosting at the edge makes for a faster, more responsive machine learning feedback loop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jaromir Coufal is an engineer with Red Hat. He joins the show to talk about modern applications of edge computing, and how the demand for edge computing is creating a market opportunity for companies that have lots of servers at the edge, such as telecoms. These telecoms can repurpose their widely distributed telecom infrastructure as edge servers that they can sell usage on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every large company generates large amounts of data. Data engineering is the process of storing, transforming, and leveraging that data. Data infrastructure companies provide tools and platforms for performing data engineering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last fifteen years has seen a rise in modern data management companies built in a time of decreasing storage costs, an increased volume of data, and the prevalence of cloud computing. Modern data companies include Hadoop vendors, cloud providers, and a wide variety of individual software companies offering products such as databases, ETL tools, and open source tooling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The go-to-market strategy for a data infrastructure company requires a deep understanding of the data engineering landscape. A company must build something useful, sell it to customers, and eventually build a replicable strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sean Knapp is the CEO of </span><a href="https://www.ascend.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ascend</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a company that builds Apache Spark-based data pipelines that connect APIs, data lakes, and data warehouses together to enable data applications. Sean joins the show to talk about the process of building a data infrastructure company, and his lessons building Ascend.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slack is a messaging platform for organizations. Since its creation in 2013, Slack has quickly become a core piece of technology used by a wide variety of technology companies, groups, and small teams. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The messages that are sent on Slack are generated at a very high volume, and are extremely sensitive. These messages must be stored on Slack’s servers in a way that does not risk a message from one company accidentally being accessible to another company. The messages must be highly available, and they also must be indexed for search.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Slack was scaling, the company started to encounter limitations in its data infrastructure that the company was unsure how to solve. During this time, Josh Wills was the director of data engineering at Slack, and he joins the show to retell the history of his time at Slack, and why the problem of searching messages was so hard. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Josh also provides a great deal of industry context around how engineers from Facebook and Google differ from one another. When Slack was starting to become popular, the company quickly began to attract engineers from both of those companies. Facebook and Google have distinct solutions for how they have tackled the problems of data engineering.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NoSQL databases provide an interface for storing and accessing data that allows the user to work with data in an “unstructured” fashion. SQL databases require the data in the database to be “normalized,” meaning that each object in the entire database has an entry (or a null value) for each field. One advantage of NoSQL is that the different objects are “denormalized,” meaning that different objects in the database can have unique fields.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a widely held belief that NoSQL databases do not scale, or that there is some significant penalty that a developer will pay for using a NoSQL database as soon as their app becomes popular. The truth is much more subtle than that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NoSQL databases can perform as well as or better than SQL databases if the developers know the query patterns that their applications make. SQL databases will be a better choice in the condition where the database has a very wide spectrum of access patterns. But in many cases, an application has a narrow range of different requests for the database, and a NoSQL database can perform very well if the database is structured and optimized for these requests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rick Houlihan is an executive with Amazon Web Services who works with database teams and engineers to optimize their products and database infrastructure. Rick joins the show to discuss the tenets of NoSQL and describe the fundamental contrast between NoSQL and SQL database limitations.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a virtualized server product that provides the user with scalable compute infrastructure. EC2 was created in 2006 as one of the first three AWS services along with S3 and Simple Queueing Service. Since then, EC2 has provided the core server infrastructure for many of the companies that have been built in the cloud. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A large scale virtualization product requires its engineers to have a deep understanding of scheduling and multitenancy. In previous shows, we have touched on subjects such as hypervisors, the noisy neighbor problem, the cold start problem, and other aspects of multitenant infrastructure. To make EC2 successful, these issues must be continuously revisited and resolved at different areas of the stack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dave Brown joined the EC2 team in 2007, and now leads the EC2 Compute, Networking, and Load Balancing teams as a Vice President. Dave joins the show to discuss the history of EC2 and the canonical problems of virtualized server infrastructure. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon’s container offerings include ECS (Elastic Container Service), EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service), and Fargate. Through these different offerings, Amazon provides a variety of ways that a user can manage Kubernetes clusters and standalone container instances. The choice of which containerization system to choose depends on the needs of the user, and the tradeoffs they want to make on control and portability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon’s container products have been designed in the context of a shifting competitive landscape. Kubernetes presents a potential long-term threat to Amazon’s status as the most popular cloud provider. Properly responding to this threat has required Amazon to extend itself into the world of open source, contributing to Kubernetes and having more conversations with customers who want their products to have the high quality user experience of AWS along with the open characteristics of Kubernetes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abby Fuller is a principal technologist with Amazon who works on containers and Linux. Abby joins the show to describe Amazon’s perspective on containers and Kubernetes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Kubernetes project was started, Amazon Web Services was the dominant cloud provider. Most of the code that runs AWS is closed source, which prevents an open ecosystem from developing around AWS. Developers who deploy their application onto AWS are opting into a closed, controlled ecosystem, which has both costs and benefits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The software industry has a history of closed and open ecosystems existing at the same time. AWS represented a huge closed ecosystem. With the amount of money at stake in the cloud business, it was only a matter of time before a more open ecosystem emerged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the creation of Kubernetes, the world of cloud computing has evolved rapidly. Google and Microsoft have both invested heavily into Kubernetes, and Amazon itself has adapted to the newer competitive landscape with a Kubernetes offering of its own. Amazon has also made efforts to become more publicly involved in open source projects, including Kubernetes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelsey Hightower has been a part of the Kubernetes ecosystem since the project was started. He is one of the most recognizable faces in the world of Kubernetes, delivering keynotes, appearing on podcasts, and co-authoring the popular </span><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kubernetes-Running-Dive-Future-Infrastructure/dp/1491935677"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kubernetes Up and Running</span></a></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Kelsey joins the show to discuss the progress in the Kubernetes ecosystem, and the competitive dynamics between Kubernetes and AWS.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">freeCodeCamp was started five years ago with the goal of providing free coding education to anyone on the Internet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">freeCodeCamp has become the best place to begin learning how to write software. There are many other places that a software engineer should visit on their educational journey, but freeCodeCamp is the best place to start, because it is free, and there are no advertisements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For most people learning to code, the price of that education is important, because they are learning to code to build a new career. It’s also important that a new programmer learns from an unbiased source of information, because an ad-supported environment will educate the new programmer towards products that they might not need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">freeCodeCamp has not been easy to build. Building freeCodeCamp has required expertise in software engineering, business, media, and community development. The donation-based business model of freeCodeCamp doesn’t collect very much money. Why would somebody build a non-profit when they could spend their time building a highly profitable software company?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quincy Larson is the founder of freeCodeCamp, and he joins the show for a special episode about his backstory and the journey to building the best place on the Internet for a new programmer to begin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The software category known as “no-code” describes a set of tools that can be used to build software without writing large amounts of code in a programming language.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No-code tools use visual interfaces such as spreadsheets and web based drag-and-drop systems. In previous shows, we have covered some of the prominent no-code products such as </span><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2019/05/10/airtable-with-howie-liu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airtable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2019/10/11/webflow-no-code-with-vlad-magdolin/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Webflow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2019/11/19/bubble-code-free-programming-with-emmanuel-straschnov-and-joshua-haas/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bubble</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is clear that no-code tools can be used to build core software infrastructure in a manner that is more abstract than the typical software engineering model of writing code.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No-code tools do not solve everything. You can’t use a no-code tool to build a high performance distributed database, or a real-time multiplayer video game. But they are certainly useful for building internal tools and basic CRUD applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know that no-code tools can create value. But how do they fit into the overall workflow of a software company? How should teams be arranged now that knowledge workers can build certain kinds of software without writing code? And how should no-code systems interface with the monoliths, microservices, and APIs that we have building for years?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shawn Wang is an engineer with </span><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/netlify"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Netlify</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a cloud provider that is focused on delivering high-quality development and deployment experience. Netlify is not a no-code platform, but Shawn has explored and written about the potential of no-code systems. Since he comes from a code-heavy background, he is well-positioned to give a realistic perspective on how no-code systems might evolve to play a role in the typical software development lifecycle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roblox is a gaming platform with a large ecosystem of players, creators, game designers, and entrepreneurs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world of Roblox is a three-dimensional environment where characters and objects interact through a physics engine. Roblox is multiplayer, and users can interact with each other over the Internet. Roblox is not one single game—it is a system where anyone can design and monetize their own games within Roblox.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last 14 years, Roblox has grown to be massively popular. As the product has grown, the software has evolved to meet changes in consumer demands and engineering constraints.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Client devices include mobile phones, desktop computers, and virtual reality. All of these clients must have a consistent experience in graphics and functionality. The backend platform has to support a high volume of concurrent players who are accessing a high volume of content. The networking needs to support multiple players operating in an environment that demands high bandwidth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claus Moberg is a vice president of engineering at Roblox. He joins the show to discuss the engineering of Roblox and the future of gaming.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cruise is a company that is building a fully automated self-driving car service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The infrastructure of a self-driving car platform presents a large number of new engineering problems. Self-driving cars collect vast quantities of data as they are driving around the city. This data needs to be transferred from the cars onto cloud servers. The data needs to be used for training machine learning models. These models must be tested in a simulated environment, which provides more data to be integrated back into the self-driving system that is deployed to the cars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the cars drive around the city, they can communicate with custom cloud services to get information about traffic, navigation, and weather. Cloud services are also used for internal tooling that can help with automotive diagnostics, configuration changes, deployments, and security policy management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The software platform used to manage infrastructure at Cruise is a combination of cloud products, open source tools, and custom built infrastructure that is mostly deployed to Kubernetes. Karl Isenberg is an engineer at Cruise, and he joins the show to talk about the engineering requirements of building a self-driving car service, and Cruise’s approach to platform engineering.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk is a company that builds security tools for companies that are consuming open source. Guy Podjarny is the CEO of Snyk, and he joins the show to discuss the security vulnerabilities of open source projects, and how his business works. Guy was previously the CTO of Akamai, so he has significant experience in technical leadership. He also is the host of the podcast The Secure Developer, which I recommend for anyone who is interested in technical interviews about security topics.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The downstream effects of automation also leads to new jobs, such as data labeling and robot operations. The net effect of modern automation technology is unclear, but it is likely to cause some disruption in the job market. Universal Basic Income (UBI) is an economic policy idea in which a government sends money to every person living in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of UBI is to reduce the impact of dramatic changes to the economy that are resulting from accelerating technological change. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Logging provides raw data that can be abstracted into higher level information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Logs are generated at every layer of infrastructure: physical host, virtual machine, container, pod, and Kubernetes cluster. Logs are generated by network proxies, edge servers, and API requests. There is far too much logging information to be read by humans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Log messages need to be refined into statistical metrics that can be put into charts. A high volume of log messages can be used to detect anomalies across a system. If unusual behavior is present in a system, the relevant log messages can be identified and sent to a human operator for them to triage and respond to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kalyan Ramanathan works at Sumo Logic, a platform for log management and continuous intelligence. Sumo Logic recently published the Continuous Intelligence Report, which is based on a study of over 2000 technology companies. This is a useful data set for anyone who is looking to understand adoption of cloud products and Kubernetes, and it can be found at </span><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/sumologic"><span style="font-weight: 400;">softwareengineeringdaily.com/sumologic.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Kalyan joins the show to discuss log management, continuous intelligence, and the data that Sumo Logic gathered in the Continuous Intelligence Report.

<p>An office is a central meeting point for everyone in an organization. Offices allow for high bandwidth, in-person communication. Employees have access to shared resources, such as food, tables, and quiet working space. Offices provide a means of encouraging a common culture within a given workplace.</p>
<p>There are also significant downsides to offices&#8211;most notably the commute. Employees often spend between one and four hours per day driving to the office. Office work creates a huge restriction for parents with a young child to take care of. Many employees feel more productive when they are working at home, or working from a coffee shop.</p>
<p>Remote work is becoming an increasingly popular mode of work for knowledge workers. Remote work has been made possible by increased bandwidth, more powerful computers, and new communications software such as Slack and Zoom.</p>
<p>Remote work is a powerful trend that is reshaping how knowledge workers spend their time. It is also changing how companies are structured. A “remote first” culture impacts hiring, human resources, engineering, sales, work-life balance and every other aspect of operations. The downstream impacts of remote work will change the labor market even more thoroughly, and cause us to rethink contracting, equity structures, and the traditional five day workweek.</p>
<p>Philip Thomas is the co-founder and CEO of Moonlight Work, a marketplace for software engineers who work on contract projects full-time or part-time. Philip is also the co-author of the <em>Remote Work Encyclopedia,</em> which is a collection of strategies and tactics for knowledge workers and companies that are looking to adapt successfully to the changes that remote work is bringing to the world.</p>
<p>Philip joins the show to discuss remote work and his experience building Moonlight. Full disclosure: I am an investor in Moonlight Work.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine learning algorithms have existed for decades. But in the last ten years, several advancements in software and hardware have caused dramatic growth in the viability of applications based on machine learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smartphones generate large quantities of data about how humans move through the world. Software-as-a-service companies generate data about how these humans interact with businesses. Cheap cloud infrastructure allows for the storage of these high volumes of data. Machine learning frameworks such as Apache Spark, TensorFlow, and PyTorch allow developers to easily train statistical models.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These models are deployed back to the smartphones and the software-as-a-service companies, which improves the ability for humans to move through the world and gain utility from their business transactions. And as the humans interact more with their computers, it generates more data, which is used to create better models, and higher consumer utility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The combination of smartphones, cloud computing, machine learning algorithms, and distributed computing frameworks is often referred to as “artificial intelligence.” Chris Benson is the host of </span><a href="https://changelog.com/practicalai"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the podcast Practical AI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and he joins the show to talk about the modern applications of artificial intelligence, and the stories he is covering on Practical AI. On his podcast, Chris talks about everything within the umbrella of AI, from high level stories to low level implementation details.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The container orchestration wars ended in 2016 with Kubernetes being the most popular open source tool for deploying and managing infrastructure. Since that time, most large enterprises have been implementing a “platform strategy” based around Kubernetes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A platform strategy is a plan for creating a consistent experience for software engineers working throughout an enterprise. At most companies, a software engineer should be thinking about business logic&#8211;whether that logic is related to banking, insurance, oil and gas, or e-commerce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, engineers at many enterprises need to think about continuous delivery, application deployment, security policy management, and other deeply technical problems that have nothing to do with the business that they are actually working at. Kubernetes is a foundational open source building block that allows enterprises to base the rest of their infrastructure decisions around. Kubernetes has made it much more viable for enterprises to pursue a platform strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With widespread adoption of Kubernetes, there is a business opportunity for companies that can offer other platform solutions that build on top of Kubernetes. A service mesh is one such tool. A service mesh provides networking and security features for all the services in an organization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The service mesh category is a large business opportunity because it sits on the critical path of every network request that goes through an enterprise. It is a potential insertion point for lots of other products including logging agents, distributed tracing, network packet scanning, security policy management, and A/B testing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The potential for business expansion is why so many businesses are entering the service mesh category today, from cloud providers to API gateways. Buoyant was one of the first companies to work on a service mesh tool, with the Linkerd open source project. William Morgan is the CEO of Buoyant, and he returns to the show to discuss the competitive dynamics of the service mesh market.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kubernetes has created a widespread system for deploying and managing infrastructure. As Kubernetes has been increasingly adopted, companies are thinking about how to leverage that common layer of infrastructure. With the common infrastructure abstraction of Kubernetes, it becomes easier to adopt other abstractions that are uniform across the entire company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This has created a market opportunity for products such as a service mesh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A service mesh consists of sidecar containers that get deployed alongside services in a distributed system. Each sidecar container is used as a proxy for all the communication that goes through the service it is deployed with. This consistent proxying layer provides each service with benefits such as security, routing, telemetry, and policy management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Istio is a service mesh that was created and open sourced by Google. Istio is built around the Envoy service proxy sidecar and a control plane that manages the Envoy sidecars. Since the launch of Istio, some of the Google employees who were working on Istio have started Tetrate, a company with the goal of commercializing Istio into a product that enterprises will pay for.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The market demand for service mesh has been proven, but there are many competitors to Tetrate. Istio is open source and can be commercialized by other companies, as well as cloud providers such as Google and AWS. Linkerd is a service mesh built by the company Buoyant, which was the first company to focus exclusively on this space. There are other companies that are expanding existing products into service mesh: Kong, NGINX, and Hashicorp.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zack Butcher is a founding engineer with Tetrate, and he joins the show to discuss the market for service mesh and the plan for Tetrate to build a business around Istio.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cloud provider gives a developer low-cost compute infrastructure on-demand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud providers can be divided up into two categories: Layer 1 cloud providers and Layer 2 cloud providers. A Layer 1 cloud provider such as Amazon Web Services owns server hardware and sells compute infrastructure as a commodity. A Layer 2 cloud provider purchases compute infrastructure from a Layer 1 provider and builds a high quality developer experience on top of that compute infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heroku was the first Layer 2 cloud provider. Heroku’s first business was to provide a high quality developer experience and low cost containerization infrastructure on top of Amazon’s EC2 virtual machine infrastructure. Heroku has added features for continuous integration, relational databases, caches, and queueing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building a Layer 2 cloud provider is a very different challenge than building a Layer 1 cloud provider. A Layer 1 provider must focus on low level problems such as hardware infrastructure and virtualization. This does not leave much time for focusing on developer experience. A Layer 1 cloud provider must be able to serve every type of potential software customer. A Layer 2 provider can provide a streamlined experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mark Turner is an engineer at Heroku. He joins the show to discuss the architecture and engineering of a Layer 2 cloud provider. Heroku is built on top of Amazon Web Services, and the core compute infrastructure is built on top of a pool of EC2 virtual machines that are continually scheduled with applications that users create on Heroku. Full disclosure: Heroku is a sponsor of Software Engineering Daily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Java has been popular since the 90s, when it started to be used as a programming language for enterprises. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Java is still widely deployed, but the infrastructure environment is dramatically different. Java is often deployed to containers in the cloud. If those containers can share resources, then those containers can share the same underlying Java infrastructure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Java 13 is the most recent public release of Java. The new features in Java 13 reflect the changing demands of modern application developers. Georges Saab is an engineer with Oracle who has been working on Java for more than a decade. He joins the show to discuss how Java development patterns are changing, and how the language is evolving to accommodate those changes, including discussion of garbage collection and dynamic application class data sharing.</span></p>

<p>Relational databases provide durable transactional systems for storing data. The relational model has existed for decades, but the requirements for a relational database have changed.</p>
<p>Modern applications have requirements for high volumes of data that do not fit onto a single machine. When a database gets too big to fit on a single machine, that database needs to be sharded into smaller subsets of the data. These database shards are spread across multiple machines, and as the database grows, the database can be resharded to scale to even more machines.</p>
<p>To ensure durability, a database needs to be replicated. The database needs to be able to survive any single machine losing power or getting destroyed.</p>
<p>Sharding and replication allow a relational database to be scalable, durable, and highly available. There are many ways to build sharding and replication into a database. Karthik Ranganathan and Sid Choudhury are engineers with YugabyteDB, a distributed SQL database.</p>
<p>In today’s episode, we discuss the modern requirements of a distributed SQL database, and compare the applications of distributed SQL to those of other systems such as Cassandra and Hadoop. We also talk through the competitive market of cloud-based distributed SQL providers such as Google Cloud Spanner and Amazon Aurora. YugabyteDB is an open source database that competes with these other relational databases. Full disclosure: YugabyteDB is a sponsor of Software Engineering Daily.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EconTalk is a weekly economics podcast that has been going for a decade. On EconTalk, Russ Roberts brings on writers, intellectuals, and entrepreneurs for engaging conversations about the world as seen through the lens of economics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Russ Roberts is today’s guest, and it is a treat because I have been listening to EconTalk since 2006 and it was a central point of inspiration for what Software Engineering Daily has become. On this episode, we talk about how software impacts the world economically, from bitcoin’s promise of zero cost transactions to the opportunities and regulatory challenges of the software-enabled gig economy.</span></p>

<p><em>Originally published May 24, 2018</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a user takes a ride on Uber, the app on the user’s phone is communicating with Uber’s backend infrastructure, which is writing to a database that maintains the state of that user’s activity. This database is known as a transactional database or “OLTP” (online transaction processing). Every active user and driver and UberEATS restaurant is writing data to the transactional data store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Periodically, that data is copied from the transactional data system to a different data storage system, where that data can be queried for large-scale data analysis. For example, if a data scientist at Uber wants to get the average amount of miles that a given user rode in February, that data scientist would issue a query to the analytical data cluster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber uses the Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) to store analytical data. On this file system, Uber has a version history of all of the company’s useful historical data. Trip history, rider activity, driver activity&#8211;every data point that is in the transactional database&#8211;but in a file format that is easier to query for large scale processing. This file format is known as Parquet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data scientists, machine learning engineers, and real-time application developers all depend on the massive quantities of data that are stored in these Parquet files on Uber’s HDFS cluster. To simplify the access of that data by many different clients, Uber uses Presto, an analytical query engine originally built at Facebook. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presto translates SQL queries into whatever query language is necessary to access the underlying storage medium&#8211;whether that storage system is an ElasticSearch cluster, a set of Parquet files, or a relational database. Presto is useful because it simplifies the relationship between data engineers and the application developers who are building on top of the data engineering infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today’s show, Zhenxiao Luo joins to give an end-to-end description of Uber’s data infrastructure&#8211;from the ingest point of the OLTP database to the OLAP data storage system on HDFS, to the wide range of data systems and applications that run on top of that OLAP data.</span></p>

<p><em>Originally published January 4, 2019</em></p>
<p>When a user makes a request to product like The <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2017/11/30/react-and-graphql-at-new-york-times/">New York Times</a>, that request hits an API gateway. An API gateway is the entry point for an external request. An API gateway serves several purposes: authentication, security, routing, load balancing, and logging.</p>
<p>API gateways have grown in popularity as applications have become more distributed, and companies offer a wider variety of services. If an API is public, and anyone can access it, you might need to apply rate limiting so that users cannot spam the API. If the API is private, the user needs to be authenticated before the request is fulfilled.</p>
<p>Kong is a company that builds infrastructure for API management. The Kong API gateway is a widely used open source project, and Kong is a company built around supporting and building on top of the API gateway.</p>
<p>Marco Palladino is the co-founder and CTO of Kong. He joins the show to tell the story of starting Kong eight years ago, and how the API gateway product evolved out of an API marketplace. Marco also discusses the architecture of Kong and his vision for how the product will develop in the future&#8211;including the Kong service mesh.</p>

<p><em>Originally published June 7, 2018</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moore’s Law states that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles about every two years. Moore’s Law is less like a “law” and more like an observation or a prediction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moore’s Law is ending. We can no longer fit an increasing amount of transistors in the same amount of space with a highly predictable rate. Dennard scaling is also coming to an end. Dennard scaling is the observation that as transistors get smaller, the power density stays constant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These changes in hardware trends have downstream effects for software engineers. Most importantly&#8211;power consumption becomes much more important. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a software engineer, how does power consumption affect you? It means that inefficient software will either run more slowly or cost more money relative to our expectations in the past. Whereas software engineers writing code 15 years ago could comfortably project that their code would get significantly cheaper to run over time due to hardware advances, the story is more complicated today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why is Moore’s Law ending? And what kinds of predictable advances in technology can we still expect?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Hennessy is the chairman of Alphabet. In 2017, he won a Turing award (along with David Patterson) for his work on the RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Compiler) architecture. From 2000 to 2016, he was the president of Stanford University.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John joins the show to explore the future of computing. While we may not have the predictable benefits of Moore’s Law and Dennard scaling, we now have machine learning. It is hard to plot the advances of machine learning on any one chart (as we explored </span><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/06/04/openai-compute-and-safety-with-dario-amodei/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in a recent episode with OpenAI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). But we can say empirically that machine learning is working quite well in production.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If machine learning offers us such strong advances in computing, how can we change our hardware design process to make machine learning more efficient?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As machine learning training workloads eat up more resources in a data center, engineers are developing domain specific chips which are optimized for those machine learning workloads. The Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) from Google is one such example. John mentioned that chips could become even more specialized within the domain of machine learning. You could imagine a chip that is specifically designed for a LSTM machine learning model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are other domains where we could see specialized chips&#8211;drones, self-driving cars, wearable computers. In this episode, John describes his perspective on the future of computing, and offers some framework for how engineers can adapt to that future.</span></p>

<p><em>Originally published November 4, 2016</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.indiehackers.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indie Hackers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a website that profiles independent developers who have made profitable software projects, usually without raising any money. These projects make anywhere from a few hundred dollars a month to more than $100,000 as in the case with park.io, one of the services profiled by Indie Hackers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Courtland Allen is the creator, engineer, and interviewer behind Indie Hackers. For each business that is profiled by Indie Hackers, Courtland conducts a short interview with the founder. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Courtland joins the show to discuss the changing trends that are making it easier to bootstrap a software business if you are a capable developer&#8211;or even if you are a nontechnical person who understands how software works. Since Courtland and I are both in the business of interviewing engineers, we had a lot to talk about, and this is a fantastic episode.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New software abstractions always take advantage of the abstractions that have been built before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software libraries allow us to import code that sits on the same host as a new program. Open source software let us copy and paste existing code, or clone entire repositories. Cloud providers offer hosted tools and APIs that we can leverage to develop scalable, easy-to-use infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When existing pieces of software are built into new software, the existing software becomes a dependency. Managing those dependencies is an engineering problem. Mya Pitzeruse is the founder of deps.cloud, a project with the goal of improving dependency changes across a company’s ecosystem. In today’s show, we talk about the modern dependency issues of a large company, and her perspective on how to address them. Mya has developed the project </span><a href="https://findcollabs.com/project/deps-cloud-GIOlcUiHE9XD2UVlxrNl"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in public on FindCollabs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and we also spend some time talking about building in the open.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web applications are used on a wide variety of platforms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On each of these platforms the web app needs to load properly and allow the user to navigate the website and interact with all of the user flows, such as sign-up, login, and the various read and write operations that make up the functionality of any website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is difficult to ensure web application functionality across all platforms, because there are so many platforms. Different operating systems, different underlying hardware, different browsers, and different device form factors all create potential sources of suboptimal website functionality and performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Testing web applications often involves the work of a manual quality assurance (QA) employee. The QA can simulate the procedures that a normal user would go through. This QA process ensures that the website is operating as expected. But the manual workflow can slow down software development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gabriel-James Safar is a software engineer and the founder of Madumbo, which was acquired by Datadog. Madumbo was founded with the goal of making web application testing simpler by identifying errors in pages and enabling users to create test suites from recordings of user activity. This process simplifies and accelerates the testing process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gabriel-James joins the show to talk about his experience building Madumbo, and his perspective on the modern application testing process. Full disclosure: Datadog is a sponsor of Software Engineering Daily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HTTP is a protocol that allows browsers and web applications to communicate across the Internet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone knows that HTTP is doing some important work, because “HTTP” is at the beginning of most URLs that you enter into your browser. You might be familiar with the request/response model, and HTTP request methods such as GET, PUT, and POST. But unless you have had a reason to learn more about the details of HTTP, you probably don’t know much more than that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julia Evans is a software engineer and writer who creates </span><a href="https://wizardzines.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wizard Zines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a series of easy-to-read online magazines that explain technical software topics. Julia’s zines include “Linux Debugging Tools”, “Help! I Have A Manager!”, and recently “HTTP: Learn your browser’s language”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her zines are a creative, innovative format for describing the world of software engineering while also exploring her own artistic pursuits in writing, design, and illustration. Julia was </span><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/06/05/profilers-with-julia-evans/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">previously on the show to discuss Ruby profiling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and she returns to the show to discuss HTTP, as well as her creative process and goals with Wizard Zines.</span></p>

These profiles describe features such as work-life balance, company culture, daily routines, and strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lynne Tye created Key Values with the goal of building a small business that would make money through connecting job seekers to companies with a culture that matched their own personal values system. Key Values has become highly successful, and Lynne is making enough money from the business to live comfortably.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2017/12/13/engineering-values-with-lynne-tye/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a previous episode, Lynne and I discussed her founding story and the engineering of Key Values.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Today’s episode picks up a few years later, with Lynne having found significant success with her own company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lynne’s software business is an example of a growing trend: “Indie Hackers”. This trend was identified by Courtland Allen, founder of the </span><a href="http://indiehackers.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indie Hackers platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Courtland is close friends with Lynne, and Lynne’s desire to start her own software company was influenced by her conversations with Courtland.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a certain point, Lynne was considering raising money and growing Key Values. She was accepted into Y-Combinator. But she decided to stick with the Indie Hackers route, and grow the business independently. Lynne joins the show to talk about the process of starting a software business, and the pivotal decisions she has made around financing, growth, and her own psychology.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vision of code-free programming has existed for decades. Software engineers have always dreamed of empowering non-technical users with the same creative tools that programmers have access to. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many years, the underlying technology of the web was not powerful enough to make this dream a reality. Platforms such as WordPress, Squarespace, and Wix have allowed for some of the functionality of programming without writing code, but the scope of what those tools could accomplish was limited.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the web has caught up. Improvements in browser technology and client devices mean that the end user has access to more powerful technology. The API economy encapsulates large amounts of functionality into cheap, well-defined functionality. No-code platforms are finding success among developers and non-developers, after persisting for several years as their technology matured.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bubble is a code-free platform for building websites, startups, and internal tools. Emmanuel Straschnov and Joshua Haas are the founders of Bubble, and they join the show to tell the story of Bubble, and give their perspective on engineering, business, and the low-code movement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The story of Bubble is strikingly similar to that of no-code tools </span><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2019/05/10/airtable-with-howie-liu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airtable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2019/10/11/webflow-no-code-with-vlad-magdolin/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Webflow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which we have covered in previous episodes. All of these products have taken years to get to maturity, with no shortcuts&#8211;only gritty, difficult engineering problems and performance improvements. Each of these no-code platforms has an inspiring story behind them, and persistent founders who eventually got their product to success.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Serverless” is an execution model where applications are scheduled and deployed to servers that are not directly managed by the application developer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In serverless execution, an application only loads and operates when a user actually needs to get a response from that application. This saves on resources, because many applications do not need to run at all times&#8211;they only need to be available for user requests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The serverless model was popularized by Amazon Web Services Lambda. When Lambda first launched in 2015, it was an experimental product. Today, it is a widely used product and the market has validated the desire for serverless execution. Other cloud providers have introduced different models of serverless functionality including Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions, and Fastly edge computing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zack Bloom is director of product for product strategy at Cloudflare, and he joins the show to discuss Cloudflare’s model for serverless execution. Zack also discusses Cloudflare’s growing product line, including the fast, privacy-protecting DNS resolver 1.1.1.1. Zack is a rare mix of engineering, business strategy, and product vision, which made for a great conversation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies want to be able to maximize the value they get from their large data sets, but there are so many steps required for deriving that value that most companies feel like they are always far behind the ideal state of where they could be. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cloud makes it cheap to save data. Tools like Spark and Snowflake give us usable APIs for simplifying the data processing. Workflow engines like Airflow help us visualize a complex execution path of a data pipeline. With all of this tooling, why is it so hard to make use of our data?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nick Schrock is the creator of Dagster, an open source system for building modern data applications. Nick is also the CEO of Elementl, a company that he is building around Dagster. Before creating Dagster, Nick worked at Facebook, where he co-created GraphQL. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nick returns to the show to discuss modern data engineering, and why it continues to be so difficult for engineers to be productive with their data.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Java programs run in a different environment than they did ten years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modern infrastructure runs on containers sitting in a Kubernetes cluster. The optimal configuration for a Java program in that context is different than it was for an environment dominated by virtual machines and bare metal. When you are co-scheduling your services with each other, those services could be fighting for resources. You may want to optimize them with more ahead-of-time compilation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quarkus is a system for accelerating Java performance through the use of GraalVM. In a previous show, we explored the basics of GraalVM. In today’s show, Guillaume Smet and Emmanuel Bernard join the show to describe an application of GraalVM: the acceleration of Java. Guillaume and Emmaneul are engineers at Red Hat, and are working on changes to the Java ecosystem that are informed by the cloud and the rise of Kubernetes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crash monitoring emerged as a software category over the last decade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crash monitoring software allows developers to understand when their applications are crashing on client devices. For example, we have an app for Software Engineering Daily that people download on Android or iOS. Users download the app to their smartphone. When the user is playing an episode, and the app crashes, the details of the crash are sent to a server that collects all of these crash reports.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crash reports allow a company to understand where their application is breaking on client devices. This is important, since there are so many client surfaces to test, from iOS to Android to browsers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a business, crash monitoring is a category that has some similarities to log management. There are lots of companies that offer crash monitoring. At first glance, it seems like a simple problem to solve. It seems like a market without winner-take-all or winner-take-most dynamics. But at scale, crash monitoring becomes a deeply complex engineering problem. From indexing to database choices to complex distributed systems tradeoffs, crash monitoring is not a simple business, and it promises to provide an extremely good business for the few companies who are able to out-execute the crowded market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James Smith is the CEO of <a href="https://bugsnag.com">Bugsnag</a>, a company that makes crash monitoring and application stability tools. James returns to the show to discuss the growth-stage engineering challenges of error monitoring, and the business opportunities that come with them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frontend software development has become as complex as backend development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a time when frontend web development was simple. There was a small number of JavaScript frameworks and templating systems. Your CSS was simple configuration for the colors on your webpage. Today, there is a giant ecosystem of frontend tools, APIs, and middleware delivering data to the user.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gatsby is a framework based on React that allows developers to build performant web applications. Gatsby is not easy to explain. In some ways, it is like a compiler for your website. Gatsby pulls in the data that you need to build your website, including CMS data, APIs, and markdown, and then links that information into React components and CSS. This happens on the server, so your user gets served a website that does not require lots of round trips as your website renders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyle Mathews and Sam Bhagwat are the founders of Gatsby, the company that is based around GatsbyJS. They join the show to describe their vision for the framework, and their vision for the company.</span></p>
